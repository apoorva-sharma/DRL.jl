## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Julia

It's actually not so gradiose. 

Julia implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Currently working on:
* Model-Free Episodic Control (QEC)

To work on:
* Deep Q learning (DQN)
* Stochastic Policy Gradient (SDPG)
* Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
* Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
* Trust Region Generalized Advantage Estimate (TRGAE)
